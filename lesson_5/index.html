            <p>
                In metal typesetting, a font is a particular size, weight and style of a typeface. Each font is a
                matched
                set of
                type, with a piece (a "sort") for each glyph. A typeface consists of various fonts that share an overall
                design.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the 21st century, with the advent of computer fonts, the terms "font" and "typeface" are often used
                interchangeably, although the term "typeface" refers to the design of typographical lettering, whereas
                the
                term
                "font" refers to the specific style of a typeface, such as its size and weight. For instance, the
                typeface
                "Bauer Bodoni" (sample shown here) includes fonts "Roman" (or "Regular"), "Bold" and "Italic"; each of
                these
                exists in a variety of sizes. The term "font" is correctly applied to any one of these alone but may be
                seen
                used loosely to refer to the whole typeface. When used in computers, each style is in a separate digital
                "font
                file".
            </p>

            <p>
                In both traditional typesetting and computing, the word "font" refers to the delivery mechanism of the
                typeface.
                In traditional typesetting, the font would be made from metal or wood type: to compose a page may
                require
                multiple fonts or even multiple typefaces.

                    <p>
                        The word font (traditionally spelled fount in British English, but in any case pronounced
                        /ˈfont/) derives from Middle French fonte "[something that has been] melted; a casting". The
                        term refers to the process of casting metal type at a type foundry.
                    </p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="metal-type">

                <h2 id="metal-type">Metal type</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        In a manual printing (letterpress) house the word "font" would refer to a complete set of metal
                        type
                        that would be used to typeset an entire page. Upper- and lowercase letters get their names
                        because
                        of which case the metal type was located in for manual typesetting: the more distant upper case
                        or
                        the closer lower case. The same distinction is also referred to with the terms majuscule and
                        minuscule.
                    </p>



                    <p>
                        Unlike a digital typeface, a metal font would not include a single definition of each character,
                        but
                        commonly used characters (such as vowels and periods) would have more physical type-pieces
                        included.
                        A font when bought new would often be sold as (for example in a Roman alphabet) 12pt 14A 34a,
                        meaning that it would be a size 12-point font containing 14 uppercase "A"s, and 34 lowercase
                        "A"s.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The rest of the characters would be provided in quantities appropriate for the distribution of
                        letters in that language. Some metal type characters required in typesetting, such as dashes,
                        spaces
                        and line-height spacers, were not part of a specific font, but were generic pieces that could be
                        used with any font.[3] Line spacing is still often called "leading", because the strips used for
                        line spacing were made of lead (rather than the harder alloy used for other pieces). This
                        spacing
                        strip was made from lead because lead was a softer metal than the traditional forged metal type
                        pieces (which was part lead, antimony and tin) and would compress more easily when "locked up"
                        in
                        the printing "chase" (i.e. a carrier for holding all the type together).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the 1880s–1890s, "hot lead" typesetting was invented, in which type was cast as it was set,
                        either piece by piece (as in the Monotype technology) or in entire lines of type at one time (as
                        in
                        the Linotype technology).
                    </p>

            <div class="characteristics">

                <h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>
                        In addition to the character height, when using the mechanical sense of the term, there are
                        several
                        characteristics which may distinguish fonts, though they would also depend on the script(s) that
                        the
                        typeface supports. In European alphabetic scripts, i.e. Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek, the main
                        such
                        properties are the stroke width, called weight, the style or angle and the character width.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The regular or standard font is sometimes labeled roman, both to distinguish it from bold or
                        thin
                        and from italic or oblique. The keyword for the default, regular case is often omitted for
                        variants
                        and never repeated, otherwise it would be Bulmer regular italic, Bulmer bold regular and even
                        Bulmer
                        regular regular. Roman can also refer to the language coverage of a font, acting as a shorthand
                        for
                        "Western European".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Different fonts of the same typeface may be used in the same work for various degrees of
                        readability
                        and emphasis, or in a specific design to make it be of more visual interest.
                    </p>

                    <div class="weight">

                        <h3 id="weight">Weight</h3>

                        <p>
                            The weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their
                            height.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A typeface may come in fonts of many weights, from ultra-light to extra-bold or black; four
                            to six weights are not unusual, and a few typefaces have as many as a dozen. Many typefaces
                            for office, web and non-professional use come with a normal and a bold weight which are
                            linked together. If no bold weight is provided, many renderers (browsers, word processors,
                            graphic and DTP programs) support a bolder font by rendering the outline a second time at an
                            offset, or smearing it slightly at a diagonal angle.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The base weight differs among typefaces; that means one font may appear bolder than another
                            font. For example, fonts intended to be used in posters are often bold by default while
                            fonts for long runs of text are rather light. Weight designations in font names may differ
                            in regard to the actual absolute stroke weight or density of glyphs in the font.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Attempts to systematize a range of weights led to a numerical classification first used by
                            Adrian Frutiger with the Univers typeface: 35 Extra Light, 45 Light, 55 Medium or Regular,
                            65 Bold, 75 Extra Bold, 85 Extra Bold, 95 Ultra Bold or Black. Deviants of these were the "6
                            series" (italics), e.g. 46 Light Italics etc., the "7 series" (condensed versions), e.g. 57
                            Medium Condensed etc., and the "8 series" (condensed italics), e.g. 68 Bold Condensed
                            Italics. From this brief numerical system it is easier to determine exactly what a font's
                            characteristics are, for instance "Helvetica 67" (HE67) translates to "Helvetica Bold
                            Condensed".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first algorithmic description of fonts was made by Donald Knuth in his Metafont
                            description language and interpreter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The TrueType font format introduced a scale from 100 through 900, which is also used in CSS
                            and
                            OpenType, where 400 is regular (roman or plain).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Mozilla Developer Network provides the following rough mapping to typical font weight
                            names:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Thin / Hairline - 100</li>
                            <li>Ultra-light / Extra-light - 200</li>
                            <li> Light - 300</li>
                            <li>Normal / regular - 400</li>
                            <li>Medium 500</li>
                            <li>Semi-bold / Demi-bold - 600</li>
                            <li>Bold - 700</li>
                            <li>Extra-bold / Ultra-bold - 800</li>
                            <li>Heavy / Black - 900</li>
                            <li>Extra-black / Ultra-black - 950</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Font mapping varies by font designer. A good example is Bigelow and Holmes's Go Go font
                            family.
                            In this family, the "fonts have CSS numerical weights of 400, 500, and 600. Although CSS
                            specifies 'Bold' as a 700 weight and 600 as Semibold or Demibold, the Go numerical weights
                            match
                            the actual progression of the ratios of stem thicknesses: Normal:Medium = 400:500;
                            Normal:Bold =
                            400:600".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The terms normal, regular and plain (sometimes book) are used for the standard-weight font
                            of a
                            typeface. Where both appear and differ, book is often lighter than regular, but in some
                            typefaces it is bolder.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="img/weights.png" alt="weight" width="400">
                            <img src="img/regular_and_bold.png" alt="Regular & Bold" width="500">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Before the arrival of computers, each weight had to be drawn manually. As a result, many
                            older
                            multi-weight families such as Gill Sans and Monotype Grotesque have considerable differences
                            in
                            weights from light to extra-bold. Since the 1980s, it has become common to use automation to
                            construct a range of weights as points along a trend, multiple master or other parameterized
                            font design. This means that many modern digital fonts such as Myriad and TheSans are
                            offered in
                            a large range of weights which offer a smooth and continuous transition from one weight to
                            the
                            next, although some digital fonts are created with extensive manual corrections.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As digital font design allows more variants to be created faster, a common development in
                            professional font design is the use of "grades": slightly different weights intended for
                            different types of paper and ink, or printing in a different region with different ambient
                            temperature and humidity. For example, a thin design printed on book paper and a thicker
                            design printed on high-gloss magazine paper may come out looking identical, since in the
                            former
                            case the ink will soak and spread out more. Grades are offered with characters having the
                            same
                            width on all grades, so that a change of printing materials does not affect copy-fit.
                            Grades are common on serif fonts with their finer details.

                                In European typefaces, especially Roman ones, a slope or slanted style is used to
                                emphasize
                                important words. This is called italic type or oblique type. These designs normally
                                slant to
                                the right in left-to-right scripts. Oblique styles are often called italic, but differ
                                from
                                "true italic" styles.

                                Italic styles are more flowing than the normal typeface, approaching a more handwritten,
                                cursive style, possibly using ligatures more commonly or gaining swashes. Although
                                rarely
                                encountered, a typographic face may be accompanied by a matching calligraphic face
                                (cursive,
                                script), giving an exaggeratedly italic style.

                            <p>
                                In many sans-serif and some serif typefaces, especially in those with strokes of even
                                thickness, the characters of the italic fonts are only slanted, which is often done
                                algorithmically, without otherwise changing their appearance. Such oblique fonts are not
                                true italics, because lowercase letter shapes do not change, but are often marketed as
                                such.
                                Fonts normally do not include both oblique and italic styles: the designer chooses to
                                supply
                                one or the other.

                                Since italic styles clearly look different to regular (roman) styles, it is possible to
                                have "upright italic" designs that take a more cursive form but remain upright; Computer
                                Modern is an example of a font that offers this style. In Latin-script countries,
                                upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex documents
                                where a section of text already in italics needs a "double italic" style to add emphasis
                                to it. For example, the Cyrillic minuscule "т" may look like a smaller form of its
                                majuscule "Т" or more like a roman small "m" as in its standard italic appearance; in
                                this case the distinction between styles is also a matter of local preference.

                                In Frutiger's nomenclature the second digit for upright fonts is a 5, for italic fonts a

                                The two Japanese syllabaries, katakana and hiragana, are sometimes seen as two styles or
                                typographic variants of each other, but usually are considered separate character sets
                                as a few of the characters have separate kanji origins and the scripts are used for
                                different purposes. The gothic style of the roman script with broken letter forms, on
                                the other hand, is usually considered a mere typographic variant.

                                Cursive-only scripts such as Arabic also have different styles, in this case for example

                                There are other aspects that can differ among font styles, but more often these are
                                considered intrinsic features of the typeface.[citation needed] These include the look
                                of digits (text figures) and the minuscules, which may be smaller versions of the
                                capital letters (small caps) although the script has developed characteristic shapes for
                                them. Some typefaces do not include separate glyphs for the cases at all, thereby
                                abolishing the bicamerality. While most of these use uppercase characters only, some
                                labeled unicase exist which choose either the majuscule or the minuscule glyph at a
                                common height for both characters.

                            Some typefaces include fonts that vary the width of the characters (stretch), although this
                            feature is usually rarer than weight or slope. Narrower fonts are usually labeled
                            compressed, condensed or narrow. In Frutiger's system, the second digit of condensed fonts
                            is a 7. Wider fonts may be called wide, extended or expanded. Both can be further classified
                            by prepending extra, ultra or the like. Compressing a font design to a condensed weight is a
                            complex task, requiring the strokes to be slimmed down proportionally and often making the
                            capitals straight-sided. It is particularly common to see condensed fonts for
                            sans-serif and slab-serif families, since it is relatively practical to modify their
                            structure to a condensed weight. Serif text faces are often only issued in the regular
                            width.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These separate fonts have to be distinguished from techniques that alter the letter-spacing
                            to
                            achieve narrower or smaller words, especially for justified text alignment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Most typefaces either have proportional or monospaced (for example, those resembling
                            typewriter
                            output) letter widths, if the script provides the possibility. Some superfamilies include
                            both
                            proportional and monospaced fonts. Some fonts also provide both proportional and fixed-width
                            (tabular) digits, where the former usually coincide with lowercase text figures and the
                            latter
                            with uppercase lining figures.

                        <p>
                            The width of a font will depend on its intended use. Times New Roman was designed with the
                            goal
                            of having small width, to fit more text into a newspaper. On the other hand, Palatino has
                            large
                            width to increase readability. The "billing block" on a movie poster often uses extremely
                            condensed type in order to meet union requirements on the people who must be credited and
                            the
                            font height relative to the rest of the poster.

                        <h3 id="optical">Optical size</h3>

                        <p>
                            Optical sizes refer to different versions of the same typefaces optimised for specific font
                            sizes. For instance, thinner stroke weight might be used if a font style is intended
                            for large-size display use, or ink traps might be added to the design if it is to be printed
                            at
                            small size on poor-quality paper. This was a natural feature in the metal type period for
                            most typefaces, since each size would be cut separately and made to its own slightly
                            different
                            design. As an example of this, experienced Linotype designer Chauncey H. Griffith
                            commented in 1947 that for a type he was working on intended for newspaper use, the 6 point
                            size
                            was not 50% as wide as the 12 point size, but about 71%.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Optical sizing declined in use as pantograph engraving emerged, while phototypesetting and
                            digital fonts further made printing the same font at any size simpler. A mild revival has
                            taken
                            place in recent years, although typefaces with optical sizes remain rare. The
                            recent variable font technology further allows designers to include an optical size axis for
                            a
                            typeface, which means end users can manually adjust optical sizing on a continuous scale.
                            Examples of variable fonts with such an axis are Roboto Flex and Helvetica Now Variable.

                        <p>
                            Optical sizes are more common for serif fonts, since their typically finer detail and higher
                            contrast benefits more from being bulked up for smaller sizes and made less overpowering at
                            larger ones. Furthermore, it is often desirable for mathematical fonts (i.e., typefaces
                            designed for typesetting mathematical equations) to have two optical sizes below "Regular",
                            typically for higher-order superscripts and subscripts which are very small in sizes.
                            Examples
                            of such mathematical fonts include Minion Math and MathTime 2.

                                Naming schemes for optical sizes vary. One such scheme, invented and popularised by
                                Adobe, labels the variant designs by their typical usages (with the intended point sizes
                                varying slightly by typefaces):
                            </p>

                                <li>Display: Large sizes, typically 19–72 point</li>
                                <li>Subhead: Large text, typically about 14–18 point</li>
                                <li>"Regular" or "Text": Usually left unnamed, typically about 10–13 point</li>
                                <li>Small Text (SmText): Typically about 8–10 point</li>
                                <li>Caption: Very small, typically about 4–8 point</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Other type designers and publishers might use different naming schemes. For instance,
                                the
                                smaller optical size of Helvetica Now is labelled "Micro", while the display variant of
                                Hoefler Text is called "Titling". Another example is Times, whose variants are labelled
                                by their intended point sizes, such as Times Ten, Times Eighteen, and Times New
                                Roman Seven.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Variable fonts typically do not use any naming scheme, because the inclusion of an
                                adjustable optical size axis means optical sizes are not released as separate products.

                            Font metrics refers to metadata consisting of numeric values relating to size and space in
                            the
                            font overall, or in its individual glyphs. Font-wide metrics include cap height (the height
                            of
                            the capitals), x-height (the height of the lowercase letters) and ascender height, descender
                            depth, and the font bounding box. Glyph-level metrics include the glyph bounding box, the
                            advance width (the proper distance between the glyph's initial pen position and the next
                            glyph's
                            initial pen position), and sidebearings (space that pads the glyph outline on either side).

                            digital (and some metal type) fonts are able to be kerned so that characters can be fitted
                            more
                            closely; the pair "Wa" is a common example of this.

                            Some fonts, especially those intended for professional use, are duplexed: made with multiple
                            weights having the same character width so that (for example) changing from regular to bold
                            or
                            italic does not affect word wrap.[36] Sabon as originally designed was a notable example of
                            this. (This was a standard feature of the Linotype hot metal typesetting system with regular
                            and
                            italic being duplexed, requiring awkward design choices as italics normally are narrower
                            than
                            the roman.)

                            A particularly important basic set of fonts that became an early standard in digital
                            printing
                            was the Core Font Set included in the PostScript printing system developed by Apple and
                            Adobe.
                            To avoid paying licensing fees for this set, many computer companies commissioned
                            "metrically
                            compatible" knock-off fonts with the same spacing, which could be used to display the same
                            document without it seeming clearly different. Arial and Century Gothic are notable examples
                            of
                            this, being functional equivalents to the PostScript standard fonts Helvetica and ITC Avant
                            Garde respectively. Some of these sets were created in order to be freely
                            redistributable, for example Red Hat's Liberation fonts and Google's Croscore fonts, which
                            duplicate the PostScript set and other common fonts used in Microsoft software such as
                            Calibri.[42][better source needed] It is not a requirement that a metrically compatible
                            design
                            be identical to its origin in appearance apart from width.

                        <p>
                            Although most typefaces are characterised by their use of serifs, there are superfamilies
                            that
                            incorporate serif (antiqua) and sans-serif (grotesque) or even intermediate slab serif
                            (Egyptian) or semi-serif fonts with the same base outlines.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A more common font variant, especially of serif typefaces, is that of alternate capitals.
                            They
                            can have swashes to go with italic minuscules or they can be of a flourish design for use as
                            initials (drop caps).

                            Typefaces may be made in variants for different uses. These may be issued as separate font
                            files, or
                            the different characters may be included in the same font file if the font is a modern
                            format such
                            as OpenType and the application used can support this.

                        <p>
                            Alternative characters are often called stylistic alternates. These may be switched on to
                            allow
                            users more flexibility to customise the font to suit their needs. The practice is not new:
                            in the
                            1930s, Gill Sans, a British design, was sold abroad with alternative characters to make it
                            resemble
                            fonts such as Futura popular in other countries, while Bembo from the same period has two
                            shapes of
                            "R": one with a stretched-out leg, matching its fifteenth-century model, and one less-common
                            shorter
                            version.[47] With modern digital fonts, it is possible to group related alternative
                            characters into
                            stylistic sets, which may be turned on and off together. For example, in Williams Caslon
                            Text, a
                            revival of the 18th century font Caslon, the default italic forms have many swashes matching
                            the
                            original design. For a more spare appearance, these can all be turned off at once by
                            engaging
                            stylistic set 4.[48] Junicode, intended for academic publishing, uses ss15 to enable a
                            variant form
                            of "e" used in medieval Latin. A corporation commissioning a modified version of a
                            commercial font
                            for their own use, meanwhile, might request that their preferred alternates be set to
                            default.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is common for fonts intended for use in books for young children to use simplified,
                            single-storey
                            forms of the lowercase letters a and g (sometimes also y and l); these may be called infant
                            or
                            schoolbook alternates. They are traditionally believed to be easier for children to read and
                            less
                            confusing as they resemble the forms used in handwriting. Often schoolbook characters are
                            released as a supplement to popular families such as Akzidenz-Grotesk, Gill Sans and Bembo;
                            a
                            well-known font intended specifically for school use is Sassoon Sans.

                            Besides alternate characters, in the metal type era The New York Times commissioned custom
                            condensed
                            single sorts for common long names that might often appear in news headings, such as
                            "Eisenhower",
                            "Chamberlain" or "Rockefeller".
